Set up for Auto Scaling Group

Inside Terraform registry you can find the latest launch resource under Auto Scaling Group for your choice of code commands to run.

example used

resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "bar" {
  availability_zones = ["us-east-1a"]
  desired_capacity   = 1
  max_size           = 1
  min_size           = 1

  launch_template {
    id      = aws_launch_template.foobar.id
    version = "$Latest"
  }
}
---------------------------------------

When coding an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) in Terraform, the key is to define everything around a solid Launch Template, since this controls your AMI, instance type, user data, and IAM permissions. Your ASG should reference multiple subnets across different Availability Zones for high availability, and you must clearly set your min, desired, and max capacity so AWS knows how to scale. If you're using an ALB, make sure your ASG attaches to a 
target group and uses ELB health checks so unhealthy instances get replaced correctly. It’s also essential to propagate tags at launch so all instances stay properly labeled, and to use user data for any bootstrapping 
commands your EC2 instances need. Finally, combining your ASG with scaling policies and CloudWatch alarms ensures your application scales automatically based on real demand.
